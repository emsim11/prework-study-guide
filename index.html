        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <br>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
              <li>One of three core languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
              <li>It's used to create the structure of a website.</li>
              <li>HTML Elements: Provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the website.</li>
              <li>!DOCTYPE: The first line of code in the file, which lets the browser know what type of document to expect when the file is opened.</li>
              <li>For HTML, the "!DOCTYPE html" declaration tells the browser to expect HTML on the page.</li>
              <li>lang: The second line of code in the file; an attribute that tells the browser what the language of a webpage is.</li>
              <li>Opening Tag: Represents the root, or start, of the HTML document.</li>
              <li>Inside the HTML opening tag, we designate an attribute of lang="en", which tells the browser that the language for the webpage is English.</li>
              <li>HTML Attributes: Define additional information about an element; they are always defined in the beginning element.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Head Element</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, for the web application.</li>
              <li>Metadata: Data about the webpage that is used by the browser to effectively serve the webpage to users.</li>
              <li>Typically, metadata is not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
              <li>Inside the head element, we can use the following metadata elements: title, style, base, link, meta, and script.</li>
              <li>Title Element: Defines the title of the document, showing it in the webpage's tab; this element is required and is important for Search Engine Optimization.</li>
              <li>Style Element: Defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
              <li>Base Element: Defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
              <li>Link Element: Connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
              <li>Meta Element: Defines metadata, such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport. </li>
              <li>Meta element examples: The charset element sets the character encoding; The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content; The viewport element sets the default view for the webpage.</li>
              <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
              <li>All of these meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser, but won't be visible to the user.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Body Element</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The body element of an HTML document contains the content shown to users when they look at the webpage in a browser.</li>
              <li>All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body.</li>
              <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements; the element that holds all the child elements is known as the parent element.</li>
              <li>The body element defines the body of the document, and it is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
              <li>Semantic HTML elements are used to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
              <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
              <li>Using semantic HTML elements in your code makes your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser. It also plays an important role in assuring that your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
              <li>Examples of non-semantic elements include div, which creates a division in the page, and span, which creates an inline division.</li>
              <li>It is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible - especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
              <li>Content within visible HTML elements is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags are often represented by angle brackets with associated tag names contained inside. Closing tags begin with a forward slash. Content is inserted between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
              <li>Note: An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
              <li>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents, with H1 being the largest. There should only be one H1 in the HTML document.</li>
              <li>The p element represents a paragraph or a block of text, and it is used extensively to wrap most of the text on the webpages.</li>
              <li>The ul, ol, and li HTML elements represent lists. The ul element renders an unordered, or bullet, list. The ol element renders a numbered, or numerical, list. The li TAG is used inside ordered or unordered lists to define a list item.</li>
              <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
              <li>The img element has the following attributes: src and alt.</li>
              <li>The src attribute is the most important, as it defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
              <li>The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. It can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>
              <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
              <li>The a element, which stands for anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
              <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
              <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. They elegantly organize the content on the page based on the relevant topics.</li>
              <li>Each section element has an id attribute that matches the topic. HTML uses the id attribute to identify elements and select them.</li>
              <li>Each section element also has a class attribute, which works in a similar way to the id.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Main Element</h3>
          <br>
          <h3>Footer Element</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page.</li>
              <li>It usually contains the author, copyright, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

          <li>git commit -m: commits changes that have been staged to the repository; use the -m flag to associate a message with the commit that is a short descriptive message of the changes implemented</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: used to check if current, local branch is up to date/synced with the remote branch in GitHub before opening a pull request; this is extremely important in a team environment</li>
          <li>It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code. You should see a message in your terminal after git pull origin main that says "Already up to date."</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/feature-name: pushes up all of the changes to the remote repository</li>
